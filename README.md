# Net Games
An advanced script for making minigames on Open Net Battle servers.

### How does it work?
> This script is designed for **server coders** who are comfortable writing LUA scripts based on the ONB server API. At this time it is not useful for map makers without scripting experience, though when Netflows is released some of the functionality here may be more accessible. 

### Features
> 1. Freeze player movement while still reporting button inputs. <br>
> &nbsp; &nbsp; For example, the moveable camera during Liberation Missions
> 2. Position sprites on screen relative to the player's camera <br>
> &nbsp; &nbsp; For example, add a persistent Order Points UIs during Liberation Missions <br>
> 3. Create custom selectors with customizable cursor sprites and positioning <br>
> &nbsp; &nbsp; For example, the liberate panel selector. <br>
> 4. Respond to currently hovered selection <br>
> &nbsp; &nbsp; For example, change highlighted tiles based on which power is hovered over during liberation tile selection. <br>
> 5. Show in-game timers <br>
> &nbsp; &nbsp; For example, you can have races and time trial leaderboards.
> 6. Show in-game countdowns <br>
> &nbsp; &nbsp; For example, the sixty second countdown used in BN3 for the CyberSimon Says <br>
> And much more!
